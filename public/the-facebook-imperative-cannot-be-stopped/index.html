&#8212;Marc Benioff of SalesForce.com with his take on the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/10/facebook-imperative-cannot-be-stopped/">next-big-thing in enterprise software </a> - which will be more social, more mobile, more instant, and (hopefully) more productive.</p>

<p>We had an interesting conversation about this in Siyelo&#8217;s daily stand-up meeting, and we tend to agree with Marc&#8217;s outlook. Indeed many software applications could be improved with &#8220;social-networking&#8221; features/integration points to enable organizations to spread ideas and information.</p>
