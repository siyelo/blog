&#8212;If you&#8217;re using CanCan and came across an error like this;</p>

<p>1
The :class option has been renamed to :resource for specifying the class in CanCan.</p>

<p>And you duly updated your controller code from;</p>

<p>1
authorize_resource:class=>FundingFlow</p>

<p>To something like this;</p>

<p>1
authorize_resource:resource=>FundingFlow</p>

<p>Since, like all good programmers, you do what you&#8217;re told by error-messages. But then like some sick joke it starts mocking you with the inverse error message i.e;</p>

<p>1
The :resource option has been renamed back to :class, use false if no class.</p>

<p>Before you go and stalk Ryan B (the CanCan author) with a fully automatic assault rifle, first check your CanCan versions.</p>

<p>1234
$ gem open cancanOpen which gem? 1. cancan 1.1.1 2. cancan 1.3.2</p>

<p>Ah ha. And if you&#8217;re using RVM like we do, then your default.gems might be specifying a different version (which in our case manifested in our staging server, not on local development).</p>

<p>So by making sure you&#8217;re using the latest version (>= 1.3.2), and using the :class syntax i.e.</p>

<p>1
authorize_resource:class=>FundingFlow</p>

<p>, you might save yourself a murder (or at the very least a weapons) charge.</p>
