&#8212;Across different projects like us, you probably have a lot of development gems you like to use.Â E.g. we like;but obviously it&#8217;s a PITA (Pain In The ****) to add this gem spec to all your projects.</p>

<p>So, give this a shot;for x in $(rvm list strings); do rvm use $x@global &amp;&amp; gem install <RAD DEVELOPMENT GEM NAME>; doneThis installs a specific gem into all your global RVM gemsets. For great justice!</p>
