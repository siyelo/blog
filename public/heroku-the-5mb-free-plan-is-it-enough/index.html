&#8212;Heroku just got better.Â </p>

<p>If you like to go a little crazy vendoring gems in your Rails apps, and you like the idea of Heroku&#8217;s free (5mb) plan, then you&#8217;re in luck. Read on;</p>

<p>Do the gems installed as part of a .gems manifest count toward your storage limit? E.g. would installing 5.1mb of gems push your app over the 5mb limit on the free Blossom plan ?</p>

<p>Glenn,</p>

<p>The database plans cover database (rows) storage only. Additionally, you&#8217;re allowed a compiled code repo size of 50mb (that&#8217;s your git repo).</p>
