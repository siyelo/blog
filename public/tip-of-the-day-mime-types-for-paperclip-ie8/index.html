&#8212;If your users are receiving this kind of  error in your Paperclip-enhanced models</p>

<p>1
Logo is not one of the allowed file types</p>

<p>And your uber Cucumber regresssion tests aren&#8217;t picking it up, despite having the following standards-based MIME type validations;then you might check to see what browser they&#8217;re using.Are they using Internet Explorer? Internet Explorer 8 perhaps?Well you might want to add something along the lines of<strong>image/pjpeg</strong>to your validations. Google killed off IE6. Lets hope they do the same for IE6+2 soon.</p>
