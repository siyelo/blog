&#8212;I stumbled across a <a href="http://www.nomad8.com/files/b577d3dbe4a561a9b0f9f7ac2c27eda3-0.php">great article</a>  which outlines how to deal with User-Experience/graphic design in the context of an agile project.</p>

<p>The problem: coming up with a consistent user interface design across a website while working iteratively and incrementally.  <em> Attempt 1: Fully agile - out of the book Scrum  </em> Attempt 2: Upfront IA and graphic design  <em> Attempt 3: Post skinning  </em> Attempt 4 - &#8220;Design Chunking&#8221;. The winner. i..e. Iteration Zero begins with design, design stays 1 iteration ahead.</p>

<p>![Pastedgraphic][/images/old/2010/01/pastedgraphic1.png] Design Chunking is essentially how our projects at Siyelo have naturally evolved to-date. WIth 1-week sprint lengths, we are tending to use a 1-week planning &amp; design concept phase (&#8220;iteration zero&#8221;) before starting development (though you can start doing non-UI features during this time too).</p>
