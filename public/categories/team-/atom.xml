<p><em>Dear Siyelo</em></p>

<p><em>The time has finally come for me to leave you. My time with the company has been something I will always remember. I have had much more fun than I would have ever thought and learnt a lot in the process. However, there are several reasons that have forced my decision.</em></p>

<p><em>The truth of the matter is that, I'm feeling rather inadequate around all the other members of the team:</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Glenn:</strong>Your knowledge of bad music is something I don't think that I will ever be able to compete with. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8</a>). Need I say more?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Sachin:</strong>I'm afraid I don't think I will ever be able to grow a beard like you. It's emasculating. What really irks me is that you refuse to embrace this gift bestowed upon you.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Dalibor:</strong>I was the king of table tennis, or so I thought until you arrived earlier this year and smashed those dreams into little pieces.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Dime:</strong>Your knowledge of metal music is far superior to mine. It hurts me to admit this so I won't expand on it further.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Wendy:</strong>I'll never be as persistent as you. No, I haven't done timesheets for today.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, with our latest addition to the team, Nicole, I'm not even the prettiest person in the team!</em></p>

<p><em>I'll always treasure my time here and hope you enjoyed having me as much as I enjoyed being here.</em></p>

<p><em>Peter</em></p>
