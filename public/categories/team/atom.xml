    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ile is a recent computer science graduate who is crossing over from PHP to the wonderful world of Ruby and Rails. We did a brief Q and A with Ile.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/ile.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>How would you describe yourself?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would describe myself as a friendly, funny and chubby guy (although I&rsquo;ve lost a few kilos in the last few months) :)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What interests you about Rails?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I really like open source and its philosophy. So PHP was my getaway drug to open source. After attending a local meetup about Ruby, I got in touch with Dalibor and he showed me the beauty of Rails. I really like the Rails community, it has a lot of great resources to learn. Also, I like the way the software is done (methodologies, Agile, XP, Kanban etc) and I like testing, which is a new thing for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>How have you found working at Siyelo so far?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I really like it here (at Siyelo). Everybody is friendly &amp; there are really nice and constructive discussions. I have learned a lot in the past 2 weeks and I am looking forward to learning more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a &lsquo;Yo mama&rsquo; joke</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo mama is so fat she wears a belt from the brand &lsquo;Equator&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Are you willing to grow a moustache for Movember?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, if I could :(&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are really excited to have Ile on the team and we watch him develop as a Rails developer in the coming months.</p>

<p>Got a question for Ile? Ask him in the comments below.</p>
