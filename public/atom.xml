<p>We at Siyelo also rushed to upgrade all of our apps to the newest Rails versions. It&#8217;s not always trivial, and we ran into problems ourselves. But here&#8217;s how we went about it.</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>, a Ruby/Rails core contributor sent out two notices [<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/t1WFuuQyavI/discussion">1</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">2</a>] regarding vulnerabilities in Ruby On Rails.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s the first issue?</h2>

<p>The first issue is related to the way ActiveRecord interprets parameters in combination with the way JSON is parsed. If an attacker exploited this vulnerability it was possible to issue arbitrary database queries. And this was only the first half of the problem.</p>

<h2>And the second issue?</h2>

<p>The second issue was actually multiple vulnerabilities. Yes, plural. Aaron found multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code which would allow an attacker to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code or even perform a DDoS attack on a Ruby on Rails application. Sounds scary, right? It is; this vulnerability was found on <strong>all</strong> (current) Rails versions. Every Rails application was affected by these vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>

<p>Thanks to the great community and contributors that are developing Ruby On Rails, new versions were realeased very quickly and everyone was able to upgrade in a timely fashion. We can&#8217;t stress enough that you must upgrade your Rails applications now!</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t upgraded your Rails application yet, or you had problems while doing so, then please <a href="mailto:info@siyelo.com">get in touch with Siyelo</a> to discuss how we can help you.</p>

<p>This week our dev chat we had quite a few interesting articles posted&#8230;</p>

<p>Sachin had a keen interest in Dalibor&#8217;s <a href="http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/37-deploying-with-gitploy">Deploying with Gitploy</a>, mainly because of the sexy profile picture. Its amazing how a <a href="http://schneems.com/post/40602104940/good-simple-design">good, simple design</a> and fixing simple annoyances can make such a difference to your workflow.</p>

<p>Ile recommended reading <a href="http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/01/rails-CVE-2013-0156-metasploit.html">Use Metasploit to Verify Rails is Secured</a> and <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/1/16/what-if-cars-were-rented-like-we-hire-programmers.html">What If Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.siyelo.com/thou-shalt-clean-thy-branches-git-rebase"/>
    <updated>2013-01-15T10:18:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.siyelo.com/thou-shalt-clean-thy-branches-git-rebase</id>
    <author>Glenn Roberts</author>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often find myself wondering when to do a interactive rebase (<code>git rebase</code>) vs a squashed merge (<code>git merge --squash</code>). The answer is rather subtle and can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427238/in-git-what-is-the-difference-between-merge-squash-and-rebase">here</a>. Essentially it comes down to whether you want to continue on the branch (interactive rebase) vs merge it now (merge squash).</p>

<p>Either way, you are rewriting histories, so you have to know what you&#8217;re
doing.</p>

<p>A google search of (&#8216;git merge squash vs rebase&#8217;) turns up <a href="http://paul.stadig.name/2010/12/thou-shalt-not-lie-git-rebase-ammend.html">this article from Paul Stadig</a> which rather irks me. Paul&#8217;s stance in this article is that you should
&#8216;never&#8217; use git rebase/amend/squash. But these are all perfectly valid, and necessary parts of a healthly git workflow.</p>

<p>Interactive rebasing and merge squashing are essential if you care about having a <em>clean</em> git
history.  Linus explains it perfectly <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328438/">here</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You should rebase your <em>private</em> trees (thats a cleanup) (and never
 pull into a branch that isn&#8217;t already in good shape)</p>

<p>You must never EVER destroy other peoples history</p>

<p>Keep your own history readable and dont expose your crap</p>

<p>Never pull into a branch that isn&#8217;t already in good shape</p></blockquote>

<p>Stick to these simple rules, and rebase/squash as you please!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.siyelo.com/images/posts/coderetreat_skopje_2012.png" alt="Global Day Of Coderetreat 2012 in Skopje (Macedonia)" /></p>

<p><a href="http://coderetreat.org">Coderetreat</a> is a day-long, intensive practice event focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of &#8216;getting things done&#8217;, the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a fun and highly effective means of skill improvement.</p>

<p>While on a Coderetreat the participants try to improve their craft by learning from each other, focusing on fundamental design principles (such as the Simple Rules of Design and the SOLID principles) and by challenging many of their every day assumptions.</p>

<p>On December 8th, Coderetreats will be held all over the world as part of the <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org">Global Day of Coderetreat</a>. The Global Day of Coderetreat helps to raise awareness of Coderetreats and brings people together from all over the world. Most importantly, The Global Day of Coderetreat helps to support global efforts to find, encourage, and educate the next generation of software developers.</p>

<p>Last year, 94 cities participated. This year, it is expected approximately 200 cities to participate with an average of 15-20 participants per city.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.siyelo.com/active-merchant-and-spree"/>
    <updated>2012-11-27T10:01:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.siyelo.com/active-merchant-and-spree</id>
    <author>Sachin Ranchod</author>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Integrating an <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/active_merchant">ActiveMerchant</a> supported payment gateway into Spree is really easy but unfortunately it isn&#8217;t particularly well documented.  Below are the steps we followed to get it working:</p>

<p>For the purposes of this example, we&#8217;ll be adding PayGate PayXML as a Spree payment gateway.</p>

<p>Add the ActiveMerchant gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Gemfile</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;activemerchant&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create the PayGate class which inherits from Spree::Gateway.  The class implements the <code>provider_class</code> method which returns the relevant ActiveMerchant billing class.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#/app/models/spree/gateway/pay_gate.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGate</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">preference</span> <span class="ss">:login</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:string</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">preference</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:string</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_accessible</span> <span class="ss">:preferred_login</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:preferred_password</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">provider_class</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">ActiveMerchant</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Billing</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGateXmlGateway</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case, the ActiveMerchant::Billing::PayGateXMLGateway requires a login and password to connect and authenticate with the gateway.  Take a look at the relevant file in the ActiveMerchant repo to see what your gateway requires.  The login and password are implemented using Spree&#8217;s preferences system so that they can be filled in via the admin backend.</p>

<p>Add your new Spree gateway into the collection of payment methods Spree knows about:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#/config/application.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">after_initialize</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configuration</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">spree</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">payment_methods</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="no">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGate</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, add your new payment method via the admin backend.  Log in as an admin user, go to configuration > payment methods.  Delete the example payment methods if there are any then click &#8216;New payment method&#8217;.  Fill in the name of the payment method as &#8216;Credit Card&#8217; (assuming you are accepting credit cards) and select the gateway you added in the provider drop-down.  You&#8217;ll also need to fill in the preferences you added (in this case: login and password) with the details provided by the payment gateway.</p>

It&#8217;s got pull requests, issues, commits, examples, posts, videos and much more.</p>

<p>Sachin spent way too much time playing with the <a href="http://roxik.com/cat/">Responsive cat</a>.  You may not have heard the term  <a href="http://kkovacs.eu/the-death-star-design-pattern">&#8216;The Death Star design pattern&#8217;</a> before but we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ve come across it.

<p>Our newest addition Ile shared <a href="http://http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/december-2012-235">Killer features that are coming in Ruby 2.0.</a>.</p>

<p>Dime introduced “<a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/december-2012-235">how to achieve a more dynamic workflow</a>”, a Q&amp;A on <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/08/ux-design-qa-with-christian-holst/">Adaptive VS Responsive design</a> and lastly <a href="http://css-tricks.com/off-canvas-menu-with-css-target/">Off Canvas menu</a> layouts.</p>

<p>Finally, we think 3Sheets may have just discovered the future of User Testing:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We believe that reading books on a variety of topics is one of the easiest ways to sharpen the (professional and personal) saw. For this reason, we&#8217;ve decided to start a book club amongst the team. Every reads the same book and when we reach the deadline, we organize a Google+ Hangout to discuss our thoughts on it.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the Hangout, let us know (through the comments or on Twitter).  The next one will be on 12 Nov at 13:30 (GMT+2). We&#8217;ll be chatting about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>.</p>

<p>So far we&#8217;ve finished the following books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lean from the Trenches</li>
<li>Rocket Surgery Made Easy</li>
<li>Seductive Interaction Design</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the full list of books we would like to get through.  Some might not be well suited for a book club but we all want to tackle them at some point.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.siyelo.com/welcoming-ile"/>
    <updated>2012-11-02T15:20:00+02:00</updated>

    <author>Nicole Dirks</author>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re very proud to announce the newest addition to the Siyelo team - Ile Eftimov. Ile is a recent computer science graduate who is crossing over from PHP to the wonderful world of Ruby and Rails. We did a brief Q and A with Ile.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.siyelo.com/images/posts/ile.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>How would you describe yourself?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;I would describe myself as a friendly, funny and chubby guy (although I&#8217;ve lost a few kilos in the last few months) :)&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>What interests you about Rails?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;I really like open source and its philosophy. So PHP was my getaway drug to open source. After attending a local meetup about Ruby, I got in touch with Dalibor and he showed me the beauty of Rails. I really like the Rails community, it has a lot of great resources to learn. Also, I like the way the software is done (methodologies, Agile, XP, Kanban etc) and I like testing, which is a new thing for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>How have you found working at Siyelo so far?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;I really like it here (at Siyelo). Everybody is friendly &amp; there are really nice and constructive discussions. I have learned a lot in the past 2 weeks and I am looking forward to learning more.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a &#8216;Yo mama&#8217; joke</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Yo mama is so fat she wears a belt from the brand &#8216;Equator&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Are you willing to grow a moustache for Movember?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;I would, if I could :(&#8221;</p>

<p>We are really excited to have Ile on the team and we watch him develop as a Rails developer in the coming months.</p>

<p>Got a question for Ile? Ask him in the comments below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another week has hurried by leaving us with exactly 80 days left to the end of 2012! Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s edition of the Dev Chat round-up - let us know if you have any articles that you think we missed over the last 7 days.</p>

<p>Sachin and Glenn shared some tips &amp; tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/devtools-tips-and-tricks/#1">Chrome dev tools</a> - a great primer to getting the most out of Chrome as a developer;</li>
<li><a href="http://betterspecs.org/">How to create a great RSpec test suite</a> - a simple and easy guide to whipping your tests into shape.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sachin also shared an article about the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/10/the_secrets_to_tripadvisors_im.html">secrets to TripAdvisors impressive growth</a> (warning: not related to scaling their site but an interesting read none the less).</p>

<p>Dalibor was looking at different ways of eliminating the need to store user passwords on your site:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword">No Password</a> - a Rails gem that uses the &#8216;Forgot Password&#8217; email token functionality to give you authentication without passwords. </li>
<li><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/first-beta-release-of-mozilla-persona-login-without-passwords/">Mozilla Persona</a> - an authentication alternative to OpenID or Facebook Connect, with a focus on privacy and browser integration.</li>
</ul>


<p>And to end off, Peter shared <a href="http://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/09/25/the-copernicus-method/">&#8220;The Copernicus Method&#8221;</a>, which is a strangely accurate way of estimating the longevity of all sorts of things.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We bring you the third installment of our ever engaging Dev chat session shares.</p>

<p>Dalibor recommended that we all read <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/hklean/lean-from-the-trenches">&#8216;Lean from the Trenches: Managing Large-Scale Projects with Kanban&#8217;</a>  by Henrik Kniberg.  It&#8217;s a great look at a practical implementation of Kanban.  We&#8217;ll definitely be trying this out with future projects.</p>

<p>Peter was all about <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/971-mwrc2012-schemaless-sql-the-best-of-both-worlds">Schmaless SQL</a>  this week. Will Leinweber gave a great presentation on the topic at this year&#8217;s MountainWest RubyConf.</p>

<p>Codegram&#8217;s Lightning talk on <a href="http://talks.codegram.com/object-oriented-nirvana#/intro">Object Orientated Nirvana</a>  got Sachin thinking about ways to &#8216;force&#8217; yourself into achieving a better OO design. You might not agree with all the rules but it&#8217;s a good catalyst for discussion.</p>

<p>Glenn&#8217;s been trying to get <a href="http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/">REE-1.8.7</a> working on Mountain Lion and he found this <a href="http://coderwall.com/p/fywjrw">guide</a> particularly helpful.</p>

<p>Finally, we were debating that all important, utterly-mystifying question&#8230; &#8221;<a href="http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/142550">Did Blowing into Nintendo Cartridges Really Help</a>?&#8221;. What do you think?Have a great weekend!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of a tradition (that we borrowed from our friends at World Wide Creative) is for everyone to write a light-hearted resignation note when they leave Siyelo. Here&#8217;s the one from our resident Clojure expert, and Ping-Pong Chief, Peter Garbers;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.siyelo.com/images/old/2012/10/balls_of_fury.jpg"><img src="http://blog.siyelo.com/images/old/2012/10/balls_of_fury.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><em>Dear Siyelo</em></p>

<p><em>The time has finally come for me to leave you. My time with the company has been something I will always remember. I have had much more fun than I would have ever thought and learnt a lot in the process. However, there are several reasons that have forced my decision.</em></p>

<p><em>The truth of the matter is that, I&#8217;m feeling rather inadequate around all the other members of the team:</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Glenn:</strong>Your knowledge of bad music is something I don&#8217;t think that I will ever be able to compete with. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8</a>). Need I say more?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Sachin:</strong>I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t think I will ever be able to grow a beard like you. It&#8217;s emasculating. What really irks me is that you refuse to embrace this gift bestowed upon you.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Dalibor:</strong>I was the king of table tennis, or so I thought until you arrived earlier this year and smashed those dreams into little pieces.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Dime:</strong>Your knowledge of metal music is far superior to mine. It hurts me to admit this so I won&#8217;t expand on it further.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Wendy:</strong>I&#8217;ll never be as persistent as you. No, I haven&#8217;t done timesheets for today.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, with our latest addition to the team, Nicole, I&#8217;m not even the prettiest person in the team!</em></p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ll always treasure my time here and hope you enjoyed having me as much as I enjoyed being here.</em></p>

<p>First up, Sachin shared <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruby-security/wiki/Guide">The Ruby Security Reviewer&#8217;s Guide</a>, it&#8217;s not the most comprehensive guide but it actually provides a great introduction to the Ruby language. </p>

<p>Has the optimism around Rails disappeared? Peter took a look at &#8221;<a href="http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/03/why-critics-of-rails-have-it-all-wrong.html">Why Rail critics have it all wrong</a>?&#8221; Share your thoughts with us.</p>

<p>Glenn has been updating Siyelo&#8217;s business plan using these <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas">guideline ideas</a> from Sequoia Capital. (<a href="http://blog.siyelo.com/siyelo-drinkup-skopje">While partying in Macedonia</a>) </p>

<p>Want to run fast tests in your Rails application? Dalibor recommended <a href="https://github.com/burke/zeus">Zeus</a>. You&#8217;ll avoid writing prefork blocks in your spec helper with Spork. It also works with other Rails development tasks such as console, server, generate, and it just takes less than one second to run.</p>

<p>Dime stumbled onto quite a few interesting articles this week from <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/grid-choices/">choosing the right grids</a> for your projects to the <a href="http://jbrewer.github.com/Responsive-Measure/">final piece of responsive design</a> - scalable fonts!  </p>

<p>This week&#8217;s video features none other than the legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser: &#8221;<a href="http://brendandawes.com/blog/Glaser">I move things around until they look right</a>&#8221;, his outlook on creativity and the path to success. </p>

<p>&#8220;Anything I&#8217;ve really discovered has come through the act of making things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enjoy your weekend!</p>
