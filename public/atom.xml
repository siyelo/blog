He has eight years of professional development experience singing soulful backup, five of them sporting the latest Ruby fashions. Stuart is an established photographer and says he hasn&rsquo;t been this nervous since that HTML competition he won when he twelve. His first act as the new face of Siyelo will be to end world hunger.</p>

<p><img style="float:right; clear:left; margin-left:30px;" src="images/posts/nic_pageant.jpg" alt="Stuart"/>A spotlight tracks Nic Young onto stage, scattering disco reflections off the sequins covering his otherwise classy cocktail dress. Three years of business analysis follow in tow, and he has seven years of development experience dancing backup. Six of them are busting Ruby moves, and one shameful stand-in rocks php like it&rsquo;s &lsquo;97. Nic is a published author of short fiction and appreciates a good playlist. If crowned Miss Siyelo he&rsquo;d put a jumping castle in every home.</p>

<p>Thank you and good night.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This would be my 3rd attendence as a guest, and my 1st as a speaker.
It is humbling to be around some amazingly talented and practiced
developers, implementers and contributors of the Ruby community.
So my talk was titled: <strong>Abstracting a Service: A Case Study in Forward
Thinking with SOA</strong></p>

<p>I gave a quick round up of how in a previous project we sensed the need
to abstract early, how we came to realize this and how we approached it.</p>

<p>Including the cheap and nasty middle step along the way.</p>

<p>I name drop a few RubyGems along the way as well that helped immensely in
making this process easier.</p>

<p>Service Oriented Architecture is a massive subject on it&rsquo;s own, so if
anyone has any questions regarding my talk, please give me a shout.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here is the video.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.siyelo.com/if-you-git-merge-squash"/>
    <updated>2013-02-13T19:30:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.siyelo.com/if-you-git-merge-squash</id>
    <author>Glenn Roberts</author>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Commit early &amp; commit often is the way to go. Then squash your commits before they get merged to <code>[master]</code>. This is the gentlemanly thing to do.</p>

<p>With git, you can squash with an interactive rebase (<code>git rebase -i</code>), in which you squash your branch down to one (or two) commits. Alternatively you can use <code>git merge --squash</code> while merging the branch.</p>

<p>Having someone else merge your branch into <code>[master]</code> (unless you already paired with someone on the code) is good practice. It formalizes the code review step, and makes sure someone else is signing off on the code in case you did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUJJ-mdd9pw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m45s">this</a>. (In a way it also makes you feel the pain of code reviews where you might be pairing!)</p>

<p>Both commit-squashing methods (interactive rebase or squash-merge) give you the major benefit of a cleaner <code>git log</code> and lots of warm and fuzzies. However if you follow the above process (like we do), an interactive rebase tends to work better than a squash-merge.</p>

<p>An interactive rebase means the <strong>author</strong> is responsible for making sure their branch history is clean <em>and will merge cleanly</em>. This is nice. As a committer I know I can press the big green &lsquo;Merge Pull Request&rsquo; button and shit won&rsquo;t explode. Mostly.</p>

<p>A squash merge means the merger/committer is responsible for resolving any merge conflicts. If the committer is not the same person as the author, well, that code review just took even longer. And the Committer just rewrote history, perhaps not in a good way i.e. if someone else&rsquo;s <strong>already squashed their branch</strong>, then a merge-squash is redundant and the committer will appear as the author of that merge commit. Oops.</p>

<p>To illustrate; The &lsquo;before&rsquo; shot below reveals a beautifully squashed branch (via interactive rebase), by our hero, the fearlesss yet considerate Author, whom we shall call &lsquo;Glenn&rsquo;. The &lsquo;after&rsquo; shot shows the aftermath of a squash-merge on that same branch, by the villianous Committer, The Glory Hunter;</p>

<p><em>Before:</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4xWxJTi.png" alt="Before merge" /></p>

<p><em>After:</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V0E8eUM.png" alt="After bad squash" /></p>

<p>Oh well, at least The Glory Hunter will show up in the git-blame if anything goes awry. Merge-squash away!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We at Siyelo also rushed to upgrade all of our apps to the newest Rails versions. It&rsquo;s not always trivial, and we ran into problems ourselves. But here&rsquo;s how we went about it.</p>

<h2>What happened?</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tenderlove">@tenderlove</a>, a Ruby/Rails core contributor sent out two notices [<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/t1WFuuQyavI/discussion">1</a>, <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion">2</a>] regarding vulnerabilities in Ruby On Rails.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s the first issue?</h2>

<p>The first issue is related to the way ActiveRecord interprets parameters in combination with the way JSON is parsed. If an attacker exploited this vulnerability it was possible to issue arbitrary database queries. And this was only the first half of the problem.</p>

<h2>And the second issue?</h2>

<p>The second issue was actually multiple vulnerabilities. Yes, plural. Aaron found multiple weaknesses in the parameter parsing code which would allow an attacker to bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and execute arbitrary code or even perform a DDoS attack on a Ruby on Rails application. Sounds scary, right? It is; this vulnerability was found on <strong>all</strong> (current) Rails versions. Every Rails application was affected by these vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>

<p>Thanks to the great community and contributors that are developing Ruby On Rails, new versions were realeased very quickly and everyone was able to upgrade in a timely fashion. We can&rsquo;t stress enough that you must upgrade your Rails applications now!</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t upgraded your Rails application yet, or you had problems while doing so, then please <a href="mailto:info@siyelo.com">get in touch with Siyelo</a> to discuss how we can help you.</p>

    <id>http://blog.siyelo.com/thou-shalt-clean-thy-branches-git-rebase</id>
    <author>Glenn Roberts</author>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often find myself wondering when to do a interactive rebase (<code>git rebase</code>) vs a squashed merge (<code>git merge --squash</code>). The answer is rather subtle and can be found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2427238/in-git-what-is-the-difference-between-merge-squash-and-rebase">here</a>. Essentially it comes down to whether you want to continue on the branch (interactive rebase) vs merge it now (merge squash).</p>

<p>Either way, you are rewriting histories, so you have to know what you&rsquo;re
doing.</p>

<p>A google search of (&lsquo;git merge squash vs rebase&rsquo;) turns up <a href="http://paul.stadig.name/2010/12/thou-shalt-not-lie-git-rebase-ammend.html">this article from Paul Stadig</a> which rather irks me. Paul&rsquo;s stance in this article is that you should
&lsquo;never&rsquo; use git rebase/amend/squash. But these are all perfectly valid, and necessary parts of a healthly git workflow.</p>

<p>Interactive rebasing and merge squashing are essential if you care about having a <em>clean</em> git
history.  Linus explains it perfectly <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/328438/">here</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You should rebase your <em>private</em> trees (thats a cleanup) (and never
 pull into a branch that isn&rsquo;t already in good shape)</p>

<p>You must never EVER destroy other peoples history</p>

<p>Keep your own history readable and dont expose your crap</p>

<p>Never pull into a branch that isn&rsquo;t already in good shape</p></blockquote>

<p>Stick to these simple rules, and rebase/squash as you please!</p>

<p><a href="http://coderetreat.org">Coderetreat</a> is a day-long, intensive practice event focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of &lsquo;getting things done&rsquo;, the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a fun and highly effective means of skill improvement.</p>

<p>While on a Coderetreat the participants try to improve their craft by learning from each other, focusing on fundamental design principles (such as the Simple Rules of Design and the SOLID principles) and by challenging many of their every day assumptions.</p>

<p>On December 8th, Coderetreats will be held all over the world as part of the <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org">Global Day of Coderetreat</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are the steps we followed to get it working:
For the purposes of this example, we&rsquo;ll be adding PayGate PayXML as a Spree payment gateway.</p>

<p>Add the ActiveMerchant gem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#Gemfile</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;activemerchant&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Create the PayGate class which inherits from Spree::Gateway.  The class implements the <code>provider_class</code> method which returns the relevant ActiveMerchant billing class.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#/app/models/spree/gateway/pay_gate.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGate</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">preference</span> <span class="ss">:login</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:string</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">preference</span> <span class="ss">:password</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:string</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">attr_accessible</span> <span class="ss">:preferred_login</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:preferred_password</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">provider_class</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">ActiveMerchant</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Billing</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGateXmlGateway</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In this case, the ActiveMerchant::Billing::PayGateXMLGateway requires a login and password to connect and authenticate with the gateway.  Take a look at the relevant file in the ActiveMerchant repo to see what your gateway requires.  The login and password are implemented using Spree&rsquo;s preferences system so that they can be filled in via the admin backend.</p>

<p>Add your new Spree gateway into the collection of payment methods Spree knows about:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="c1">#/config/application.rb</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">after_initialize</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configuration</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">spree</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">payment_methods</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="no">Spree</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Gateway</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">PayGate</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, add your new payment method via the admin backend.  Log in as an admin user, go to configuration > payment methods.  Delete the example payment methods if there are any then click &lsquo;New payment method&rsquo;.  Fill in the name of the payment method as &lsquo;Credit Card&rsquo; (assuming you are accepting credit cards) and select the gateway you added in the provider drop-down.  You&rsquo;ll also need to fill in the preferences you added (in this case: login and password) with the details provided by the payment gateway.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ile is a recent computer science graduate who is crossing over from PHP to the wonderful world of Ruby and Rails. We did a brief Q and A with Ile.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.siyelo.com/images/posts/ile.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>How would you describe yourself?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would describe myself as a friendly, funny and chubby guy (although I&rsquo;ve lost a few kilos in the last few months) :)&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What interests you about Rails?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I really like open source and its philosophy. So PHP was my getaway drug to open source. After attending a local meetup about Ruby, I got in touch with Dalibor and he showed me the beauty of Rails. I really like the Rails community, it has a lot of great resources to learn. Also, I like the way the software is done (methodologies, Agile, XP, Kanban etc) and I like testing, which is a new thing for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>How have you found working at Siyelo so far?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I really like it here (at Siyelo). Everybody is friendly &amp; there are really nice and constructive discussions. I have learned a lot in the past 2 weeks and I am looking forward to learning more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a &lsquo;Yo mama&rsquo; joke</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo mama is so fat she wears a belt from the brand &lsquo;Equator&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Are you willing to grow a moustache for Movember?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, if I could :(&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are really excited to have Ile on the team and we watch him develop as a Rails developer in the coming months.</p>

<p>Got a question for Ile? Ask him in the comments below.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sachin and Glenn shared some tips &amp; tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/devtools-tips-and-tricks/#1">Chrome dev tools</a> &ndash; a great primer to getting the most out of Chrome as a developer;</li>
<li><a href="http://betterspecs.org/">How to create a great RSpec test suite</a> &ndash; a simple and easy guide to whipping your tests into shape.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sachin also shared an article about the <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/10/the_secrets_to_tripadvisors_im.html">secrets to TripAdvisors impressive growth</a> (warning: not related to scaling their site but an interesting read none the less).</p>

<p>Dalibor was looking at different ways of eliminating the need to store user passwords on your site:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword">No Password</a> &ndash; a Rails gem that uses the &lsquo;Forgot Password&rsquo; email token functionality to give you authentication without passwords. </li>
<li><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/first-beta-release-of-mozilla-persona-login-without-passwords/">Mozilla Persona</a> &ndash; an authentication alternative to OpenID or Facebook Connect, with a focus on privacy and browser integration.</li>
</ul>


<p>And to end off, Peter shared <a href="http://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/09/25/the-copernicus-method/">&ldquo;The Copernicus Method&rdquo;</a>, which is a strangely accurate way of estimating the longevity of all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
