&#8212;80% of the effort in many web development projects we&#8217;ve done was spent making the site work on ~20% of the browsers out there. Thats why its worth explaining to clients about standards-compliance, and focusing on making their sites work in those web browsers.</p>

<p>Axiis came up with <a href="http://www.axiis.org/examples/BrowserMarketShare.html">this clever visual representation</a>  of browser market share based on the W3C usage stats.<a href="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/siyelo/7Wd8kx8wmfMCfc7rIrb6DJ0V2Ynb2HrGmPZYpi6dQKD3BvY6TgjoSM63PZtA/pastedGraphic.png">![Pastedgraphic][/images/old/2009/12/pastedgraphic-png-scaled-500.jpg] </a></p>

<p>Its great to see browsers like IE6/7 losing their grip on the market. Its good news for web developers, and for their clients. Save time. Save money. Go Firefox.</p>
