  <div class="entry-content">    <p>We&#8217;ve all heard it, the browser is the future for the mobile  applications. Mobile web frameworks are getting a lot of traction  lately. Is this the turning point where these frameworks will finally  set the developers free from the walled garden model of the Apple App  Store and the complexity and resources needed for developing and  maintaining a separate code base for each platform out there?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been almost a month since the 1.0 stable release of <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" title="jQuery Mobile" target="_blank">jQuery Mobile</a>, the touch optimized mobile web framework. Only a year after John Resig announced the project in its first alpha stage, the jQuery team managed to deliver a solid release with an impressive <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/" target="_blank">graded support</a> for a wide range of mobile browsers and platforms.<p />Built upon the jQuery core and the jQuery UI, the framework aims to deliver a quick and easy way to build unified cross-platform HTML5 based user interfaces with a single code base. All you need to start building applications using the framework is knowledge of some JavaScript and some HTML5.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Building a mobile application with jQuery Mobile is extremely easy and fast</span></p>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of jQuery Mobile is that even as a newcomer to the framework you can develop a rough version of your application in a matter of days as opposed to the native application development for Android and iOS where the learning curve is not quite as steep.</p>
<p>To make your application mobile just include the jQuery Mobile files in your header</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Add the data attributes to your HTML markup</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>And this is the result:</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
<img alt="34522551610-orig" height="506" src="http://siyelo.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/34522551610-orig.png?w=189" width="320" />
</div>
</p>
<p>The framework takes care of applying the styles and positioning the elements to fit and scale nicely on any device. With just a couple of html lines we have a template for our mobile application. Off course you can add your custom css styles to tweak the looks to your desires. Also with the release of the 1.0 support for the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/10/28/announcing-themeroller-for-mobile-beta/" target="_blank">ThemeRoller</a> tool has been added, so quickly theming your application is a breeze.</p>
<p>The important part in the html snippet above are the HTML5 data-* attributes. The framework relies on these data attributes in order to do it&#8217;s magic. Older browser will ignore this attributes and just render the regular html. Basically the layout of a jQuery Mobile application is defined by the data-role attribute. In the above example we can see that we have a divs with data-roles &#8220;header&#8221;, &#8220;content&#8221; and &#8220;footer&#8221; all of which belong to the main page wrapper. Also we added a data-role on the list element in order for the framework to &ldquo;widgetize&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>By default, linking to other pages is automatically done via Ajax in a single-page model. All you need to do is define a standard links and the framework will take care of it. If the device doesn&#8217;t support Ajax for some reason the framework falls back to standard http requests. Another cool feature of the framework is linking within a multi-page document. A single page can contain many page containers defined by the data-role of &ldquo;page&rdquo; which means immediate display of the clicked page. When using this techniques combined with the page transition effects, the user experience feels almost &ldquo;native app&rdquo; like.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Web vs Native</span></p>
<p>Currently the biggest argument being used against the wider adoption of the mobile web applications is the limited access to the client device features. A common example to address this issue is combining the framework with tools like <a href="http://phonegap.com/" target="_blank">PhoneGap</a> and delivering the application as native. Combining the framework with tools like PhoneGap also minimizes the lower performance issues since all of the resources can be loaded from the device.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will see a quick adoption of the proposed <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI" target="_blank">WebAPI</a> specifications by Mozilla that define a standard of APIs that would give the browser high level access to the device components like GPS api, filesystem api, accelerometer api, dialer, messaging etc.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p>While all of those features provided by the jQuery Mobile framework are really cool and exciting, does the framework really provides a mature native-like feel and functionality to the applications built with it?</p>
<p>The jQuery team have done a great job by providing a nicely packed framework with lots of features like progressive enhancement approach, theming framework, unified widgets, modular design, a great cross-browser compatibility, even for older and less capable browsers and devices. But there is much left to be desired in the performance area. Even when trying the simple examples on a high end devices the page transition effects and the general user flow feels a little clunky. This is the area that jQuery Mobile fails short when compared to the native applications and even other Mobile Application frameworks (<a href="http://jqtouch.com/" target="_blank">jQTouch</a> or <a href="http://www.sencha.com/" target="_blank">Sencha</a>) but it probably be fixed in near future with the polishing of the rough edges.</p>

This didn&#8217;t come easily. It took lots of experimentation until we found out what exactly works for us. In this post I&rsquo;m going to give a brief outline of how we work:</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><p /><span><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Named Branches</span></strong></span><p /><span>We rarely work on dev/master. Almost every feature we work on will get it&rsquo;s own branch. Each branch will be pushed up to github in their own namepace (to prevent cluttering).</span><p /><span><span style="font-size:large;"><strong>Pull Requests</strong></span></span><p /><span>When a branch is ready to be merged into dev we like to squash all the commits in that branch. This makes it easier for people reviewing the branch to get an overview of what is being done, it also makes for a cleaner git log.</span><p /><span>We do, however, avoid squashing commits in the even changes are requested after the branch has been reviewed. We find this helps with the review process as it is easier for the reviewers to digest.</span><p /><span><strong><span style="font-size:medium;">Why pull requests?</span></strong></span><p /><span>Pull requests serve 2 functions:</span><p /><span>Firstly they give a very transparent overview of what is being worked on and what is ready to be merged and deployed.</span><p /><span>This is also a great way to have your code peer reviewed. Github allows collaborators to comment directly on a line of code or on an entire commit or feature.</span><p /><span><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Merging</span></strong></span><p /><span>Once a branch has been given the go-ahead and the CI passes, one of the reviewers will merge the branch into dev. This is partly so there is a shared responsibility of the code in the repository and so there is always more than one person who understands that feature.</span><p /><span><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Deploying</span></strong></span><p /><span>Once merged in, the branch is immediately deployed to staging.</span><p /><span>Deploying immediately will reduce big merges (merges will be easier) and we are able to gain visibility of bugs as they are introduced. &nbsp;It also gives us more time to locate possible defects, if any.</span><p /><span>If you&#8217;re looking for something more specific, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask :)</span></span></p>

  <div class="entry-content">    <p>At Siyelo we have 2 distributed teams, one in Cape Town and another one in Skopje. Naturally, we had to figure out how to do remote pair programming between the two offices. There are different available options for remote pair-programming (a great summary post available <a href="http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/articles/2011/10/17/some-people-call-me-the-remote-pairing-guy-/" title="Remote pair-programming options" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>In the past, we often used Skype for screen sharing, but the problems with Skype are:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:30px;">
<li>you don&#8217;t have control over the other screen</li>
<li>you cannot have both screen sharing and video</li>
<li>bandwidth of the internet connection sometimes can be a problem</li>
<li>it&#8217;s not a tool for pair programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently we have been experimenting with Google+ hangouts and although it has the same limitations, we prefer it over Skype for audio/video communication. But, what we really want from a remote pair-programming tool is the ability to do real time code collaboration.</p>
<p>The solution: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/screen/" title="GNU Screen" target="_blank">screen</a>. Screen can have many useful scenarios, but here I will focus on following two:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:30px;">
<li>read only - useful as a screen sharing tool by hosting read only screen session</li>
<li>permissive - useful as a real time code collaboration tool</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Here is how to setup screen for both scenarios. Note: A downside of a tool like Screen is that everyone needs to learn an editor that runs in terminal. Luckily we all like vim.<p />First we need to install SSH server because all communication will happen over secure channel:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>For the read only scenario, we need to setup guest user account on the host machine. For security reasons we will create a read-only account with <a href="http://man.he.net/man1/rbash" title="RBash shell" target="_blank">rbash</a> (<a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/restrict-linux-users-to-their-home-directories-only/" title="Restricted Bash shell" target="_blank">restricted</a> bash) shell which will be used by the programmer we want to pair with to ssh into the host  machine we control and join the screen session.</p>

<p>Next we need to setup the guest shell .profile. Add the following to /home/guest/.profile</p>

<p>Here as you can notice &#8220;screen -x dalibor/pairprog&#8221; automatically will join the session named &#8220;pairprog&#8221; that is started by &#8220;dalibor&#8221; user on &#8220;guest&#8221; user login.</p>
<p>Next we need to install screen on the host machine (if it&#8217;s not already installed).</p>

<p>For security reasons, screen by default is installed so that other users within the system can not attach to screen session (error you will get is: &#8220;Must run suid root for multiuser support.&#8221;). To allow multi user setup you need to execute following (you might need to change the path if screen is installed in /usr/bin/screen for example):</p>

<p>Then you need to add the following screen config in ~/.screenrc file</p>

<p>Most important lines are &#8220;multiuser on&#8221; which allows multiuser access in the screen session and &#8220;aclchg&#8221; command which removes all write and execute permissions for all windows (#) and all commands (?) for user guest. With this setup, host can do anything and guest can just watch the screen or message by using Ctrl-a: wall &#8220;hi there&#8221;.</p>
<p>Finally, communication goes like this: screen session is started by host with:</p>

<p>Guest SSH to the host machine and automatically joins the screen session:</p>

<p>Then they can interact in the same terminal. More on the screen commands <a href="http://aperiodic.net/screen/multiuser" title="Screen commands" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you trust the user you can add full permission with &#8220;acladd&#8221;  command, and usually it&#8217;s to be done on a shared server. Say we have user1 and  user2 logged in on shared server via SSH, user1 has added user2 in  the ~/.screenrc file.</p>

<p>And is starting pairprog screen session with:</p>

<p>Then user2 can join that session with:</p>

  <div class="entry-content">    <div>Our project had a lot of old, unwanted pre-release branch tags in our remote git repo. E.g.;</div>

<div>I needed a one-liner to find all these prerelease tags (i.e.&nbsp;all tags that end in a letter), that deletes them on the remote repo. Then I could do the same on my local.</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>Given that &#8220;git ls-remote&#8221; gives output like &#8220;&lt;SHA&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;&#8221;. E.g.;</div>

<div>a) make sure you have the tags backed up in your local repo first and&nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div>Once you&#8217;ve done a dry-run or two, run that command and watch as those pesky remote tags get deleted.</div>

<p />
<div>Similarly for removing these pre-release tags from a local git repo;</div>

<p />
<div>(This command is a lot easier to figure out since the output from &#8220;git tag -l&#8221; is simpler.&nbsp;Alternatively, for synchronization, if you don&#8217;t have any specific local tags, and are confident that remote has the tags you care about, it may be easier to wipe out all tags and pull them all from origin again.)</div>
