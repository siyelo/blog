    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This would be my 3rd attendence as a guest, and my 1st as a speaker.
It is humbling to be around some amazingly talented and practiced
developers, implementers and contributors of the Ruby community.
So my talk was titled: <strong>Abstracting a Service: A Case Study in Forward
Thinking with SOA</strong></p>

<p>I gave a quick round up of how in a previous project we sensed the need
to abstract early, how we came to realize this and how we approached it.</p>

<p>Including the cheap and nasty middle step along the way.</p>

<p>I name drop a few RubyGems along the way as well that helped immensely in
making this process easier.</p>

<p>Service Oriented Architecture is a massive subject on it's own, so if
anyone has any questions regarding my talk, please give me a shout.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here is the video.</p>
