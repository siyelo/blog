&#8212;All good developers love the terminal, and spend many hours at the command prompt.</p>

<p>All excellent developers are masters of the shell.</p>

<p>All uber developers issueÂ <a href="http://github.com/glennr/bash_profile">shell commands with obtuse aliases</a> .</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re uber, or at least becoming uber, and regularly spend time aliasing commands in your profile, here&#8217;s a script to speed that up. It will open your Bash .profile in Textmate, and reload it in your Terminal once you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p>1
alias mbp=&#8217;mate -w ~/.bash_profile &amp;&amp; source ~/.bash_profile&#8217;</p>

<p>The speedy way to create aliases that speed up your development.</p>

<p>And remember, keep it DRY.</p>
