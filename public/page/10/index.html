  <div class="entry-content">    <div><span style="letter-spacing:0;">A software developer would not be worth his salt if he couldn’t put some code together, but there are a multitude of skills and attributes that separate him from just being a programmer.&nbsp; In a world where hundreds are programmers are thrown at problems, software solutions are often not what they should be. Ultimately the quality of the work produced by good software developers is on a whole different plane, and it’s for some very good reasons.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Commitment to mastering a craft</b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;">The distinction between a job and a vocation is made clear by developers who push themselves in the following areas:</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Keeping up with technology</b>&nbsp;- The realm of possibility in software is constantly changing, and what may be a suitable way to solve a problem now may be replaced by something much better tomorrow.&nbsp; In such a dynamic environment, a passion for learning and being up to date is invaluable.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Maintaining a good attitude</b>&nbsp;- a good level of output cannot be achieved if developers are defensive about their work, and cannot handle a bit of constructive criticism.&nbsp; Individual sections of work may be perfect, but may not fit together well with others.&nbsp; Keeping an open mind and listening to other developers’ opinions facilitates learning, and can help to cut down the amount of time and effort needed for a project.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Good enough is not enough</b>&nbsp;- a good developer comes back to what they’ve done, and looks at it critically, wondering if there are any areas which could be improved.&nbsp; Critiquing work can be good for future projects, and ensuring that all solutions are always of a high quality.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Knowing where their limits lie</b>&nbsp;- there is a definite benefit to knowing where your strengths lie, and asking for advice or help in areas where you may be lacking some skills.&nbsp; No developer can know everything, and acknowledging that is a strength, as is knowing where to go to ask for help.&nbsp;</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Gaining experience</b>&nbsp;- there is a lot to be said for having a strong technical background, but it’s often in the application of knowledge that a developer comes into their own.&nbsp; Having said this, the experience needs to be relevant and varied, as doing the same thing over and over again doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been doing it the right way, or that you’d be able to tackle other challenges well.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Planning before coding</b>&nbsp;- a good developer should be doing more than just writing good code, he should have a good idea of the various system components, data repositories, data flows etc before he even starts coding.&nbsp; Having an overview of the solution means that when coding starts it will follow a design, and the project can move more efficiently towards completion.&nbsp;</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b>Test, do some testing and when that’s finished, test it again&nbsp;</b>- testing should occur from the outset, and time should be put aside for it.&nbsp; The assumption should never be made that code works, testing should be done to prove that this is the case.&nbsp; A good software developer acknowledges this and incorporates testing at all phases of programming.</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;">And then when all this achieved?</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;">&#8220;Just as importantly - and this is where a lot of developers fall short - a good developer possesses excellent soft skills - communication; time management; awareness; tactical and strategic thinking (detailed planning with an eye on the big picture); an ability to identify risk, weigh-up options and make decisions quickly; objectivity and pragmatism. He also has the courage of his convictions. A good software developer has the ability to &#8216;think&#8217; in different dimensions.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>(1)</span></div><p><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;">Well said.</span></div><p><p><p><div><span><sup>1</sup></span><span>&nbsp;Agile in action -&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.energizedwork.com/2005/05/what-makes-good-software-developer.html"><span style="text-decoration:underline;letter-spacing:0;">http://blog.energizedwork.com/2005/05/what-makes-good-software-developer.html</span></a>&nbsp;</span></div></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content">    <p>Your website is often the first point of contact for so many people and most people who have found their way to your site will navigate away too easily if there&rsquo;s not something there to hold their attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good graphics are important of course, but what else helps to hold the attention of your reader?</p>
<p class="Bullets" style="text-indent:0;margin:0 0 12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;">Make your homepage feel like home</span></strong></p>
<p class="Bullets" style="margin-left:0;text-indent:0;">This is your opportunity to make a good first impression, making it too flashy or with too much content on it could result in an information overload.</p>
<div style="margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;text-indent:0;">Some guidelines as to what information you should have:</div>
<p />
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li><span style="font-family:Symbol;"><span>&nbsp;</span></span>An outline of what is on your site, and where the reader can find it</li>
<li>Contact details</li>
<li>Why they should explore the rest of your site&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p />
<div>Your homepage needs to be able to load quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your audience has to wait a minute before they see anything, they&rsquo;re probably going to go elsewhere.</div>
<p style="margin-bottom:12pt;"><strong><span style="font-family:Arial;">Get people to come back, and back, and back</span></strong></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve managed to get someone to come to your website once, you have to have something attractive to the reader to make them come back again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong></p>
<p>Make sure your content is credible and original.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to provide new relevant content on a regular basis, so that there is something new for your reader when they come back to your site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your content also determines the strength of your presence on search engines, and with so many people using search engines every day it&rsquo;s important to make your presence felt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some ideas for keeping your content up to date:</p>
<p />
<div>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Providing a news digest (or blog), which keeps people updated on the relevant subject matter. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Offering objective analysis and feedback on current events in your industry</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Listening to and offering feedback to your customers&rsquo; comments, concerns and ideas</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;">Inviting informed contacts to write articles for you</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:small;"><span>Avoid using Flash extensively - its not as search-engine friendly as a clean, css-driven, standards-compliant website (like the ones Siyelo design)&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>
<p>Link positioning should be logical, and when you click them they should redirect you to the right place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siyelo does extensive testing to make sure that what your website does what it promises, and your software developer should offer this service too.&nbsp;&nbsp;The layout should be intuitive, and there should be a flow through your site which makes your audience feel instantly comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try not to litter your pages with hundreds of links.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to view the website from the customer&rsquo;s perspective - if you were a customer how would you want to interact with the site?</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The visuals of a site are important, but unless they are supported by compelling content, easy navigation and good solid coding, visuals on their own won&rsquo;t be able to attract people to your site and keep them coming back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some annoying things that can make people navigate away immediately:</p>
<ul class="MailOutline">
<li>Poor, dated or cookie cutter designs. Invest in a professional web designer.</li>
<li>Intros designed in Flash</li>
<li>Too many pop-up or pop-under boxes</li>
<li>Autoplay music. Let your customer choose to play music, if offering it strengthens your message</li>
<li>Busy backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<p />
<div style="margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;text-indent:0;">&nbsp;Your website is a sales team on constant duty. &nbsp;Make sure your team is informed, informative and of good quality.</div>
