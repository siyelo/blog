80% of the effort in many web development projects we've done was spent making the site work on ~20% of the browsers out there. Thats why its worth explaining to clients about standards-compliance, and focusing on making their sites work in those web browsers.

Axiis came up withÂ [this clever visual representation](http://www.axiis.org/examples/BrowserMarketShare.html) of browser market share based on the W3C usage stats.

Its great to see browsers like IE6/7 losing their grip on the market. Its good news for web developers, and for their clients. Save time. Save money. Go Firefox.
