---80% of the effort in many web development projects we've done was spent making the site work on ~20% of the browsers out there. Thats why its worth explaining to clients about standards-compliance, and focusing on making their sites work in those web browsers.

Axiis came up with [this clever visual representation](http://www.axiis.org/examples/BrowserMarketShare.html)  of browser market share based on the W3C usage stats.[![Pastedgraphic][/images/old/2009/12/pastedgraphic-png-scaled-500.jpg] ](http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/siyelo/7Wd8kx8wmfMCfc7rIrb6DJ0V2Ynb2HrGmPZYpi6dQKD3BvY6TgjoSM63PZtA/pastedGraphic.png) 

Its great to see browsers like IE6/7 losing their grip on the market. Its good news for web developers, and for their clients. Save time. Save money. Go Firefox.
