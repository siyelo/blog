headline: This week we start of Dev Chat with one of Dalibor’s favourite videos at the moment- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zalYJacOhpo">Adventure Time Bacon Pancakes New York Remix</a> - 10 Hours of bacon and pancakes remixed with Alicia Keys’ New York. Great way to end off a Friday afternoon.

Glenn recommended [Onepager](http://onepagerapp.com/) - a well designed site which solves a common problem. Glenn’s also just discovered the [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com) podcast (we know, he's a bit delayed...).  They have great panelists and interesting topics - it is practically required listening at Siyelo these days.

Ile is working on a college assignment on Rails and MongoDB for his post-graduate studie.  A great article on [Dynamic attributes and MongoDB/Mongoid](http://paul-wong-jr.blogspot.com/2012/03/dynamic-attributes-and-mongodbmongoid.html) has been helping him on his way.

Want to get a quick overview of NoSQL? Sachin shared [key points from NoSQL Distilled](http://martinfowler.com/articles/nosqlKeyPoints.html ) by Martin Fowler.

Finally, if you haven't already, we highly recommend that you sign up for the [“Now I know”](http://nowiknow.com/) daily newsletter. In the words of Jimmy Wales: "It’s always fresh, always a surprise, and always interesting!"

Happy friday!
