##Opportunity

Be a part of an entrepreneurial and focused Ruby/Rails software consultancy, where *everybody codes* (yes, even our designer Dime has mad coding skills)*.* We are looking for people with strong web development backgrounds, with a passion for clean code and great software.

We believe that all members of the product team have end-to-end responsibility - from design to demo-ing. As a developer you will participate in conceptualization and wireframing of projects, provide design feedback, be responsible for the user experience and ensure that all code we ship has 1) been fully tested and 2) kicks ass.

We are working on an exciting mix of improving and scaling existing apps and developing entirely new apps. Our team is fast, talented and independent, and we encourage Open Source contributions and community participation. 

##Requirements

* 3+ years web development experience
* Experience in Object Oriented languages & domain driven design
* Agile development practices: TDD/BDD, pair programming, refactoring
* PostgreSQL / MySQL

* Unnatural desire to learn new things
* English proficiency a must.


##Highly Regarded

* Ruby / JS / Python / Smalltalk / Java / .Net experience
* NoSQL technologies
* Front-end dev skills
* Open source contributions
* Git
