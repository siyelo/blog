    <p>Fuselage takes all the hassle out of installing several popular gems/plugins manually, as well as tidying up the default setup that the "rails" command gives you. <p /> What's different about Fuselage? A lot of the Rails templates out there at the moment are quite primitive - a bunch of commands &amp; files shoved in to a single file. Fuselage has a separate template for each gem/plugin, allowing you to specify all the relevant installs/commands/files/etc in one place. The goal here is to capture a lot of the setup logic that most Rails gems have in a single, reusable template. <p /> Fuselage avoids asking a lot of questions, so if you want to customize your install, edit "template.rb" manually. <p />  <br />Usage is very simple. You can invoke it directly from your "rails -m" command with;</p>
<p><div class="data type-text">
      <table class="lines" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="line_numbers"><span id="L1">1</span>
</pre>
          </td>
          <td width="100%">
                <div class="highlight"><pre /><div class="line" id="LC1">rails app_name -m http://github.com/siyelo/fuselage/raw/master/template.rb </div></pre></div>
