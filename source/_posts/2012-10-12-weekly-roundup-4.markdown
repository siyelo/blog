Another week has hurried by leaving us with exactly 80 days left to the end of 2012! Here's this week's edition of the Dev Chat round-up - let us know if you have any articles that you think we missed over the last 7 days.

Sachin and Glenn shared some tips & tricks:

* [Chrome dev tools](http://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/devtools-tips-and-tricks/#1) - a great primer to getting the most out of Chrome as a developer;
* [How to create a great RSpec test suite](http://betterspecs.org/) - a simple and easy guide to whipping your tests into shape.

Sachin also shared an article about the [secrets to TripAdvisors impressive growth](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/10/the_secrets_to_tripadvisors_im.html) (warning: not related to scaling their site but an interesting read none the less).

Dalibor was looking at different ways of eliminating the need to store user passwords on your site:

* [No Password](https://github.com/alsmola/nopassword) - a Rails gem that uses the 'Forgot Password' email token functionality to give you authentication without passwords.Â 
* [Mozilla Persona](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/09/first-beta-release-of-mozilla-persona-login-without-passwords/) - an authentication alternative to OpenID or Facebook Connect, with a focus on privacy and browser integration.

And to end off, Peter shared ["The Copernicus Method"](http://www.futilitycloset.com/2012/09/25/the-copernicus-method/), which is a strangely accurate way of estimating the longevity of all sorts of things.

Have a great weekend!
