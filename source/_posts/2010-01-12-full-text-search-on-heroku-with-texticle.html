    <div>We just spent some time investigating some alternative to full text search on Heroku. The initial solutions were either ThinkingSphinx (with a remote sphinx daemon, and another copy of the app running - yuck), or one of the paid options like WebSolr. None tickled our fancy. Free and simple tickle our fancy</div><p />Along comes Texticle. Not sure about the name, but it simple, and works a treat.<p /><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2009/10/17/full-text-search-on-heroku/">http://tenderlovemaking.com/2009/10/17/full-text-search-on-heroku/</a></div><p /><div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
