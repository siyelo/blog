    <div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">The decision to pay someone to develop new software for you is almost always a big one, and jumping into bed with the wrong software developer can be an expensive mistake. &nbsp; All projects have an element of uncertainty, but software related projects can be especially hard to predict, and the end result can leave the customer with considerably less in the bank.</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Below are some of the general characteristics of a software project</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Objectives - what is the scope and what are the deliverables</span></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Resources - people/finance etc</span></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Finiteness - there is a fixed time scale</span></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; and lastly</span></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Quality, which can be measured in terms of customer satisfaction and the organisation’s image.&nbsp;<span style="font-size:9px;">(1)</span></span></span></div><p /><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Bad software</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">So how much is this going to cost you?&nbsp; Let’s say that bad software is lacking in quality, which means that customer satisfaction is affected as is the organisation’s image. &nbsp;</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Let’s have a look at some of the associated costs&nbsp;</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Initial development cost (IDC)</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">Consider this as spent, a sunk cost, and if the output is unsatisfactory there are costs that arise as a result &nbsp;</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Continuing maintenance costs (MC)</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">If rework is not included in your contract you may find yourself paying for bugs to be fixed.&nbsp; If the scope of the project was not clear and agreed upon you may find that you’re not covered for any additional work.&nbsp; This can be pricey and above any formally agreed maintenance costs.</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Time (T)</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">A lot of time would have been invested in the initial software development, with meetings to discuss the objectives, identifying deliverables etc.&nbsp; If there’s bug fixing to be done you can be sure that this will result in more time being spent running backwards and forwards between supplier and customer.&nbsp; Time should be an investment, but taking time out to fix bugs is just an unnecessary expense.</span></span></div><p /><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><b><span style="font-size:12px;">Effort (E)</span></b></span></div><div><span style="letter-spacing:0;"><span style="font-size:12px;">It’s hard to allocate the cost of stress, frustration and bad relationships that result from deliverables not being met, but they’re there and they’re material.&nbsp;</span></span></div><p /><p /><p /></div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
