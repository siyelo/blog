We bring you the third installment of our ever engaging Dev chat session shares.

Dalibor recommended that we all read ['Lean from the Trenches: Managing Large-Scale Projects with Kanban'](http://pragprog.com/book/hklean/lean-from-the-trenches)  by Henrik Kniberg.  It's a great look at a practical implementation of Kanban.  We'll definitely be trying this out with future projects.

Peter was all about [Schmaless SQL](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/971-mwrc2012-schemaless-sql-the-best-of-both-worlds)  this week. Will Leinweber gave a great presentation on the topic at this year's MountainWest RubyConf.

Codegram's Lightning talk on [Object Orientated Nirvana](http://talks.codegram.com/object-oriented-nirvana#/intro)  got Sachin thinking about ways to 'force' yourself into achieving a better OO design. You might not agree with all the rules but it's a good catalyst for discussion.

Glenn's been trying to get [REE-1.8.7](http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/) working on Mountain Lion and he found this [guide](http://coderwall.com/p/fywjrw) particularly helpful.

Finally, we were debating that all important, utterly-mystifying question... "[Did Blowing into Nintendo Cartridges Really Help](http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/142550)?". What do you think?Have a great weekend!
