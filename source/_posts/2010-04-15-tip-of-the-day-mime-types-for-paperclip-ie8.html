    <div>If your users are receiving this kind of &nbsp;error in your Paperclip-enhanced models</div>
<p />
<div><div class="data type-text">
      <table class="lines" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="line_numbers"><span id="L1">1</span>
</pre>
          </td>
          <td width="100%">
                <div class="highlight"><pre /><div class="line" id="LC1">Logo is not one of the allowed file types</div></pre></div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
  </div></div>
<p />
<div>
<div>And your uber Cucumber regresssion tests aren't picking it up, despite having the following standards-based MIME type validations;</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>then you might check to see what browser they're using.</div>
<div>Are they using Internet Explorer?&nbsp;Internet Explorer 8 perhaps?</div>
</div>
<div>Well you might want to add something along the lines of <strong>image/pjpeg </strong>to your validations.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Google killed off IE6. Lets hope they do the same for IE6+2 soon.</div>
