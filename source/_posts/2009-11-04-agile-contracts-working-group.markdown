[The Agile Contracts working group](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/agile-contracts/) has an excellent sample ([fixed-price](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/agile-contracts/sample-fixed-price-agile-contract)) contract for a project delivery using SCRUM.

From memory it was posted by Jeff Sutherland and is from an actual project, so its fairly comprehensive.

(Note these are only samples and you should always seek legal advice before using 3rd-party contracts.)
