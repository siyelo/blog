    The Agile Contracts working group has an excellent sample (fixed-price) contract for a project delivery using SCRUM.

From memory it was posted by Jeff Sutherland and is from an actual project, so its fairly comprehensive :[http://www.coactivate.org/projects/agile-contracts/sample-fixed-price-agile-c...](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/agile-contracts/sample-fixed-price-agile-contract) 

(Note these are only samples and you should always seek legal advice before using 3rd-party contracts.)
