Are you using

* git ?
* GitHub ?
* Heroku ? ( or some other nice git-backed hosting? )
* multiple Heroku environments ? (e.g. Production/Staging)
* good git team workflow practices ?

Then check out this great post by the folks at New Forge;

## [Git workflow for a staging environment with Heroku and GitHub](http://blog.newforge-tech.com/technical/2010/02/01/git-workflow.html)

which tells you how to manage your git branches and keep them in sync with your Heroku instances.Â 

And here are some handy shell aliases to go with your newfound uber git/GitHub/Heroku workflow;

``` bash
alias gpow='git push origin working'
alias gpsm='git push heroku_staging staging:master'
alias gppm='git push heroku_production'
alias hmig='heroku rake db:migrate'
```
