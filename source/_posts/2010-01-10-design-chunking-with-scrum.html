    <div>I stumbled across a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nomad8.com/files/b577d3dbe4a561a9b0f9f7ac2c27eda3-0.php">great article</a>&nbsp;which outlines how to deal with User-Experience/graphic design in the context of an agile project.</div><p /><div>The problem: coming up with a consistent user interface design across a website while working iteratively and incrementally.</div><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt 1: Fully agile - out of the book Scrum</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt 2: Upfront IA and graphic design</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt 3: Post skinning</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;* Attempt 4 - "Design Chunking". The winner. i..e. Iteration Zero begins with design, design stays 1 iteration ahead.</div></div><p /><div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div><div>Design Chunking is essentially how our projects at Siyelo have naturally evolved to-date. WIth 1-week sprint lengths, we are tending to use a 1-week planning &amp; design concept phase ("iteration zero") before starting development (though you can start doing non-UI features during this time too).</div>
