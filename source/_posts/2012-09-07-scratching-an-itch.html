    <p>This week we released a very simple gem called&nbsp;<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/should_clean" target="_blank">ShouldClean</a>. &nbsp;ShouldClean is a tool to help us convert RSpec test descriptions from a pile of should (it 'should do this...', it 'should do that...') into a cleaner and simpler imperative style (it 'does this...', it 'does that...'). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The gem works by running through a specified directory and changing the offending descriptions within any spec files it finds. &nbsp;ShouldClean will remove the word 'should' and will conjugate&nbsp;the verb to its singular 3rd person, present indicative form (huh?). For example:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>it "should be true" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; it "is true"</li>
<li>it "should action something" -&gt; it "actions something"</li>
<li>it "should push something" &nbsp; -&gt; it "pushes something"</li>
<li>it "should by default be 1" &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt; it "by default is 1"</li>
</ul>
<p>Are a few extra 'shoulds' really that big of deal? Probably not - it really boils down to a matter of preference. &nbsp;For us, running this tool on projects with large test suites helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>make the tests more readable;</li>
<li>it reduces unneccessary duplication in the spec files and the test output;</li>
<li>An added benefit is that the test suite has a mood of certainty about it - reading the tests tells you what the code does, not what it should do when everything falls into place.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>ShouldClean is just a simple, fun project we undertook to make the code we look at everyday, slightly better. &nbsp;Hopefully you can find a use for it too - remember, pull requests are always welcome (<a href="http://www.github.com/siyelo/should_clean" target="_blank">http://www.github.com/siyelo/should_clean</a>)</p>
