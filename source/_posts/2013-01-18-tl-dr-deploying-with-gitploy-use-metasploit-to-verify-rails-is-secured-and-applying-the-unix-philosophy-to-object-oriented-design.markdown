headline: It's a new year and hey, so much for the Mayan Calendar prediction. Welcome back to most of our readers, may 2013 continue without anymore “end of the world” prediction theories.

This week our dev chat we had quite a few interesting articles posted...

Sachin had a keen interest in Dalibor's [Deploying with Gitploy](http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/37-deploying-with-gitploy), mainly because of the sexy profile picture. Its amazing how a [good, simple design](http://schneems.com/post/40602104940/good-simple-design ) and fixing simple annoyances can make such a difference to your workflow.

Ile recommended reading [Use Metasploit to Verify Rails is Secured](http://blog.endpoint.com/2013/01/rails-CVE-2013-0156-metasploit.html) and [What If Cars Were Rented Like We Hire Programmers?](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/1/16/what-if-cars-were-rented-like-we-hire-programmers.html).

[Applying the Unix Philosophy to Object-Oriented Design](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/11/28/your-objects-the-unix-way/) was shared by Dalibor.

Happy reading and enjoy your weekend!
