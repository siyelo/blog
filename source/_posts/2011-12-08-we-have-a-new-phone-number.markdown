Siyelo has changed its Cape Town office number to  +27 (0) 21 461 2050.

Our old landline number (+27 21 461 2559) was previously registered to the Dept of Home Affairs, and was still listed on their website, so we were getting several nuisance calls a day from irate visa applicants;

> "Good morning, Siyelo Software, Glenn speaking" <br />
> "Hi, my boyfriend is having problems with his visa application..." <br />
> **facepalm**

We decided it was easier to deal with the notorious Telkom than it was to ask Home Affairs to update their website. Talk about having to choose the lesser of two evils!
