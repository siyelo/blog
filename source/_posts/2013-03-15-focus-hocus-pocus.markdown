Hello **Siyelo**!

Today is my last day at work before heading into a new adventure. In order to skip all the resignation letter bullshit and because I received the enormous list of bugs you have been saving for me, I'll try to be very short.

After fixing all the bugs, I'll need to clean and leave the company laptop I work on too. So, I'll just try if the following command works well on Ubuntu 12.04. :) Random readers of this blog are not advised to try this at home!

``` bash
sudo rm -R /
```

Now that we are done with all of that, it's time for some enjoyment.

All the best in future!
