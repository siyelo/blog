Dalibor has been reading up on how to boost the performance of Rails apps (hat tip to [@railsonfire](http://www.twitter.com/railsonfire)):

* [How to get 4x the performance out of Heroku with Unicorn](http://blog.railsonfire.com/2012/05/06/Unicorn-on-Heroku.html)
* [Make your website super fast with Asset Pipeline, Sprites & Cloudfront](http://blog.railsonfire.com/2012/05/18/Assets-Sprites-CDN.html)

Glenn's been checking out Flask as a Python alternative to Ruby's Sinatra; [@maxinebf](https://twitter.com/maximebf) have a great [tutorial](http://maximebf.com/blog/2012/10/building-websites-in-python-with-flask/#.UIE8sGmwUqt) on the topic.  

If you haven't already seen it, Sachin recommends watching [@sandimetz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) 's [excellent presentation](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1115-gogaruco2012-go-ahead-make-a-mess) at GoGaRuCo with practical examples of how OO design can help you manage your mess
