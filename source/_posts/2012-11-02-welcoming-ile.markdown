Ile is a recent computer science graduate who is crossing over from PHP to the wonderful world of Ruby and Rails. We did a brief Q and A with Ile.

**How would you describe yourself?**

"I would describe myself as a friendly, funny and chubby guy (although I've lost a few kilos in the last few months) :)"

**What interests you about Rails?**

"I really like open source and its philosophy. So PHP was my getaway drug to open source. After attending a local meetup about Ruby, I got in touch with Dalibor and he showed me the beauty of Rails. I really like the Rails community, it has a lot of great resources to learn. Also, I like the way the software is done (methodologies, Agile, XP, Kanban etc) and I like testing, which is a new thing for me."

**How have you found working at Siyelo so far?**

"I really like it here (at Siyelo). Everybody is friendly & there are really nice and constructive discussions. I have learned a lot in the past 2 weeks and I am looking forward to learning more."

**Tell us a 'Yo mama' joke**

"Yo mama is so fat she wears a belt from the brand 'Equator'!"

**Are you willing to grow a moustache for Movember?**

"I would, if I could :("

We are really excited to have Ile on the team and we watch him develop as a Rails developer in the coming months.
