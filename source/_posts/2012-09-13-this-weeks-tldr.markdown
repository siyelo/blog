We share a lot of stuff in our Dev Chat during the course of a week - most of it isn't safe for public consumption but there are always a few things which are really interesting, thought-provoking or just plain funny.  

This post starts a series of weekly articles where we'll keep a record of our favourite finds on the internet over the previous 7 days. Hopefully you find the links below as interesting as we have: 

This week Peter has been mulling over ways of preventing a "[knowledge debt problem](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/your-company-has-a-knowledge-debt-problem.html)". He's also recommended that you watch Rich Hickey's presentation on [Simple made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy).  

Glenn has been meditating on [The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) - a brilliant list of guiding principles for software developers.

Sachin stumbled across an interview with Peter Thiel from [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/28/111128fa_fact_packer?currentPage=all) where he talks about why Silicon Valley hasn't done enough to disrupt and revolutionize the world.  It was also pretty cool to see our [ShouldClean](https://github.com/siyelo/should_clean) gem being used in a commit to [Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/commit/69a63cef280310c1164dda457bdecfd7700b10f0).

Dalibor has been thinking about how to pitch his next big business plan - David McClure makes it clear that you should [put the problem before the solution](http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2009/08/your-solution-is-not-my-problem.html).

On a lighter note - the internet has finally awoken the to the fact that skeuomorphism is getting out of hand - for instance, why would you want a [weather app that looks like a pair of pants](http://skeu.it/post/28065979636/via-domwood-i-just-dont-even-what-this-is)?! 

Lastly if you have not followed [@Sachinsbeard](http://www.twitter.com/sachinsbeard) this might convince you to do so... [The Beards - Got Me a Beard (official music video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlgbKIswpzI&feature=youtu.be&hd=1)
