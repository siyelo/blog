This week Dalibor got one step closer to his goal of [Programming like Kent Beck](http://blog.iterate.no/2012/06/20/programming-like-kent-beck/).  He also spent some time reading up on what constitutes good design and why PG thinks it's not [subjective or abstract](http://paulgraham.com/taste.html).

Ile has been beefing up his [Vim skills](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/) thanks to [@mislav's](http://twitter.com/mislav) great post.  Starting with a simple `.vimrc` which you fully understand will make it easier to 'get' the fundamentals.

He's also shared [David Copeland's](http://twitter.com/davetron5000) article on ways to improve reusability in your application - [Re-use in OO: Inheritance, Composition and Mixins](http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2012/12/19/re-use-in-oo-inheritance.html)

Sachin was reading up on ways of improving your application's performance on Heroku whilst [staying within budget](http://www.stormconsultancy.co.uk/blog/development/6-ways-to-get-more-bang-for-your-heroku-buck-while-making-your-rails-site-super-snappy/)

Wishing you well over the festive season from Siyelo!
