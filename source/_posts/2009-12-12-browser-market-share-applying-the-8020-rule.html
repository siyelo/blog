    <div>80% of the effort in many web development projects we've done was spent making the site work on ~20% of the browsers out there. Thats why its worth explaining to clients about standards-compliance, and focusing on making their sites work in those web browsers.</div><p />Axiis came up with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.axiis.org/examples/BrowserMarketShare.html">this clever visual representation</a>&nbsp;of browser market share based on the W3C usage stats.<div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
