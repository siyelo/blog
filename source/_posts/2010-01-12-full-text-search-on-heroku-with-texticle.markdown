---We just spent some time investigating some alternative to full text search on Heroku. The initial solutions were either ThinkingSphinx (with a remote sphinx daemon, and another copy of the app running - yuck), or one of the paid options like WebSolr. None tickled our fancy. Free and simple tickle our fancy

Along comes Texticle. Not sure about the name, but it simple, and works a treat.
