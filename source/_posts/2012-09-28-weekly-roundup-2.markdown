First up, Sachin shared [The Ruby Security Reviewer's Guide](http://code.google.com/p/ruby-security/wiki/Guide), it's not the most comprehensive guide but it actually provides a great introduction to the Ruby language. 

Has the optimism around Rails disappeared? Peter took a look at "[Why Rail critics have it all wrong](http://www.unlimitednovelty.com/2012/03/why-critics-of-rails-have-it-all-wrong.html)?" Share your thoughts with us.

Glenn has been updating Siyelo's business plan using these [guideline ideas](http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas) from Sequoia Capital. ([While partying in Macedonia](http://blog.siyelo.com/siyelo-drinkup-skopje)) 

Want to run fast tests in your Rails application? Dalibor recommended [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus). You'll avoid writing prefork blocks in your spec helper with Spork. It also works with other Rails development tasks such as console, server, generate, and it just takes less than one second to run.

Dime stumbled onto quite a few interesting articles this week from [choosing the right grids](http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/grid-choices/) for your projects to the [final piece of responsive design](http://jbrewer.github.com/Responsive-Measure/) - scalable fonts!  

This week's video features none other than the legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser: "[I move things around until they look right](http://brendandawes.com/blog/Glaser)", his outlook on creativity and the path to success. 

"Anything I've really discovered has come through the act of making things."

Enjoy your weekend!
