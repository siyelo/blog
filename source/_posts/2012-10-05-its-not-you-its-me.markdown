headline: Part of a tradition (that we borrowed from our friends at World Wide Creative) is for everyone to write a light-hearted resignation note when they leave Siyelo. Here's the one from our resident Clojure expert, and Ping-Pong Chief, Peter Garbers.

*Dear Siyelo*

*The time has finally come for me to leave you. My time with the company has been something I will always remember. I have had much more fun than I would have ever thought and learnt a lot in the process. However, there are several reasons that have forced my decision.*

*The truth of the matter is that, I'm feeling rather inadequate around all the other members of the team:*

***Glenn:**Your knowledge of bad music is something I don't think that I will ever be able to compete with. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNhNLi2oac8)). Need I say more?*

***Sachin:**I'm afraid I don't think I will ever be able to grow a beard like you. It's emasculating. What really irks me is that you refuse to embrace this gift bestowed upon you.*

***Dalibor:**I was the king of table tennis, or so I thought until you arrived earlier this year and smashed those dreams into little pieces.*

***Dime:**Your knowledge of metal music is far superior to mine. It hurts me to admit this so I won't expand on it further.*

***Wendy:**I'll never be as persistent as you. No, I haven't done timesheets for today.*

*Now, with our latest addition to the team, Nicole, I'm not even the prettiest person in the team!*

*I'll always treasure my time here and hope you enjoyed having me as much as I enjoyed being here.*

*Peter*
