You can read the article [here](http://www.nomad8.com/files/b577d3dbe4a561a9b0f9f7ac2c27eda3-0.php).


The problem: coming up with a consistent user interface design across a website while working iteratively and incrementally.  

* Attempt 1: Fully agile - out of the book Scrum  
* Attempt 2: Upfront IA and graphic design  
* Attempt 3: Post skinning  
* Attempt 4: "Design Chunking". The winner. i..e. Iteration Zero begins with design, design stays 1 iteration ahead.

Design Chunking is essentially how our projects at Siyelo have naturally evolved to-date. WIth 1-week sprint lengths, we are tending to use a 1-week planning & design concept phase ("iteration zero") before starting development (though you can start doing non-UI features during this time too).
