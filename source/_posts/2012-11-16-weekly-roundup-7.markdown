With 42 Days left in 2012 until the Mayan Apocalypse and the world comes to an END weâ€™ve decided to to share as much of our insight as possible!... Happy friday from Siyelo.

If you love freebies check this out. Dalibor received a free "[Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://https://twitter.com/sandimetz/status/268753825916133376)" book thanks to Sandi Metz and InformIT.  Great customer service!

Dali has been fully emerged in the [Rails 4 compilation links](http://blog.wyeworks.com/2012/11/13/rails-4-compilation-links/), a curated list of intersting links about the next release of Rails.  It's got pull requests, issues, commits, examples, posts, videos and much more.

Sachin spent way too much time playing with the [Responsive cat](http://roxik.com/cat/).  You may not have heard the term  ['The Death Star design pattern'](http://kkovacs.eu/the-death-star-design-pattern) before but we're sure you've come across it.  Finally, Sachin shared an article about [being for the benefit of future developer](http://tx.pignata.com/2012/11/being-for-the-benefit-of-future-developer.html) - an interesting read with tips about what you can do to look after the next person that'll working on your code.

Glenn shared an article on [How Startups Are Killing Off Bosses](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-startups-are-killing-off-bosses-2012-10). Dime recommended downloading [Responsive videos](http://fitvidsjs.com/), A lightweight, easy-to-use jQuery plugin for fluid width video embeds and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome ) an iconic font designed for use with Twitter Bootstrap.

Ile found [10 things you didn't know you could do with Ruby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBgnlBoIkVM) while watching cat videos on YouTube.  He also spent some time learning about things [you didn't know you could do with Chrome dev tools](http://www.igvita.com/2012/11/14/wait-chrome-devtools-could-do-that/ ).
