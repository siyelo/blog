Dali shared a few great articles with us this week:

*  [New CTO](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/09/06/I-am-Your-New-CTO.html) by Uncle Bob is an interesting read about how rational expectations from a new CTO may not always appear that way...until you look closely.
*  [Fixed Feature](http://blog.8thlight.com/paul-pagel/2011/12/16/fixed-feature.html) - an Agile method of fixed bid compensation where clients only pay for the product they receive.
*  The [Learning Pyramid](http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/polovina/learnpyramid/index.html) diagram illustrates how much better teaching or doing is for retention of new information.

It’s all too easy to give bad advice these days, Sachin recommends reading [asking questions versus giving advice](https://blog.intercom.io/asking-questions-versus-giving-advice/ ).

Our newest addition Ile shared [Killer features that are coming in Ruby 2.0.](http://http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/december-2012-235).

Dime introduced “[how to achieve a more dynamic workflow](http://www.netmagazine.com/shop/magazines/december-2012-235)”, a Q&A on [Adaptive VS Responsive design](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/08/ux-design-qa-with-christian-holst/) and lastly [Off Canvas menu](http://css-tricks.com/off-canvas-menu-with-css-target/) layouts.

Finally, we think 3Sheets may have just discovered the future of User Testing:
