```
git[master*] % git glone git@github.com:siyelo/toadhopper.git
git: 'glone' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
clone
```
<!--more-->

Yes I did git, yes I did.

@sheldonh pointed out to me that if you add this to your ~/.gitconfig

```
[help]
  autocorrect = 1
```

Then next time you stuff up a git command...

```
git[master*] % git glone git@github.com:siyelo/toadhopper.git
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'glone', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'clone'
in 0.1 seconds automatically...
