    <p>Matt Jones and I came up with a fix for this error during Dr Nic's OSS tutorial at RailsConf '10; <p /> 

<p /> Seems like GitHub is not returning correct JSON for the <a href="http://github.com/#">http://github.com/#</a>{user}/#{project}/network_meta endpoint. <p /> Fork our fix here: <p />  <a href="http://github.com/glennr/github-gem">http://github.com/glennr/github-gem</a></p>
