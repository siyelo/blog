Marc Benioff of SalesForce.com with his take on the [next-big-thing in enterprise software ](http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/10/facebook-imperative-cannot-be-stopped/) - which will be more social, more mobile, more instant, and (hopefully) more productive.

We had an interesting conversation about this in Siyelo's daily stand-up meeting, and we tend to agree with Marc's outlook. Indeed many software applications could be improved with "social-networking" features/integration points to enable organizations to spread ideas and information.
